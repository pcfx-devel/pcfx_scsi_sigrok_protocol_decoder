The following INQUIRY DATA, which indicates the attributes of the CD-ROM
drive, is transferred to the initiator only for the specified number of
bytes. However, even if the specified number of bytes is 36 bytes or more,
only 36 bytes are transferred.

    INQUIRY DATA

      DB  05H, 80H, 02H, 00H, 1FH
      DB  00H, 00H, 00H
      DB  'NEC*****'
      DB  'CD-ROM*DRIVE:FX*'

      DB  '1.0' ('1.0E')
           ***    ****

    * - varies depending on the model.

If the LUN is not 000, the first data in the INQUIRY DATA, 05H, will become
7FH, and the data after that will be undefined.

Notes:

The initiator reserves the CD-ROM drive for exclusive use.
The reservation is released only in the following cases:

(1) When a "RELEASE" command is issued by the initiator that issued the
"RESERVE" command.
(2) When a "BUS DEVICE RESET" message is received from any initiator.
(3) When the power is cycled or a RESET condition is detected.

*The initiator's ID bit must also be set in the selection phase to identify
the initiator's ID.

The specified number of transfer blocks (16 bits) of data starting from the
block specified by the READ target address (32 bits) are transferred to the
initiator.

If the number of transfer blocks is 0, nothing is transferred and the command
ends normally.

The data format to be transferred and the processing to be performed when an
error occurs are specified by the "MODE SELECT" command issued before this
command is issued.

The "MODE SELECT" value is reset to the initial value when the power is turned
on or the SCSI bus is reset.

Specifies the time until transitioning to the STOP state after a series of
operations is completed.

The set time is specified in BCD.
If the minutes:seconds are 00:00, it specifies that the device will not
automatically transition to the STOP state.

The default setting is 10 minutes.

Notes:
------
This command is invalid on PC-FX boards and PC-FXGAs, and a "normal end
status" is returned. (The initial settings are also undefined.)

Transfers the TOC (Table of Contents) data of the inserted CD to the
initiator.

    TYPE: The value of this bit determines the following.
        00B = Transfers the minimum and maximum track numbers on the disc.
        01B = Transfers the end of the program on the disc (start position
              of the lead-out area).
        10B = Transfers data related to the track specified by the TNO
              parameter in Byte 02. (TNO is expressed in BCD)
        11B = Transfers TOC data according to the TNO parameter in Byte 02.

    TNO: This parameter is valid only when the TYPE bit is 10B/11B, and
         specifies the track number, etc. to be transferred in BCD.

This command transfers information regarding the TOC (Table of Contents) data
of the CD currently inserted in the CD-ROM drive to the initiator in the
DATA IN phase that is executed following the COMMAND phase.

The amount of data transferred is 4 bytes, and if the CD-ROM drive is not in
a READY state, no data transfer is performed and a "CHECK CONDITION" status is
returned.

The transfer information can be selected using the TYPE bits in Byte 01,

+----+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

(1) POINT=A0H
The data in POINT=A0H in the TOC area (in the case of a multi-session disc,
the lead-in area of the innermost session)
    PMIN: The first track number on the disc
    PSEC: DISC-ID (00H: = CD-DA/CD-ROM, 10H: = CD-I, 20H = CD-ROM XA)
    PFRM: (00)

(2) POINT=A1H
POINT=A1H data in the TOC area (in the case of a multi-session disc, the
lead-in area of the outermost session)
    PMIN: Last track number on the disc
    PSEC: (00)
    PFRM: (00)

(3) POINT=A2H
POINT=A2H data in the TOC area (in the case of a multi-session disc, the data
in the lead-in area of ??the outermost session)
    PMIN: Start time of the lead-out area (minutes: 2 BCD digits)
    PSEC: Start time of the lead-out area (seconds: 2 BCD digits)
    PFRM: Start time of the lead-out area (sectors: 2 BCD digits)

(4) POINT=B0H (TNO=B0H) of the last session
Depending on the structure of the disc, the 10 bytes of data will be as follows:
    a) Normal disc
       All 10 bytes are 00H
    b) Hybrid single-session disc
       Subcode Q of the lead-in area of ??session 1, mode 5, POINT = B0H
       information
    c) Hybrid multi-session disc
       Subcode Q of the lead-in area of ??the last session, mode 5, POINT = B0H
       information

(5) POINT=B0H (TNO=B0H) of the last session - 1
The data of the 10 bytes will be as follows depending on the structure of the
disc.
    a) Normal disc
       All 10 bytes are 00H
    b) Hybrid single-session disc
       All 10 bytes are 00H
    c) Hybrid multi-session disc
       Subcode Q of the lead-in area of ??the last session - 1, mode 5,
       POINT = B0H information

Note: In mode 5, when POINT = B0H
    MIN, SEC, and FRAME indicate the start time of the program area of the
    next session.
    Normally, the first track of this session is 2 seconds later.
    PMIN, PSEC, and PFRAME indicate the maximum possible start time of the
    lead-out area, and therefore have no particular meaning in terms of
    control.

(6) Start time information for each track (TNO = 00H)
    PMIN: Start time for each track (minutes; 2 BCD digits)
    PSEC: Start time for each track (seconds; 2 BCD digits)
    PFRM: Start time for each track (sectors; 2 BCD digits)
        Note that the POINT value is incremented from the first track number
        to the last track number.  (2 BCD digits)

Important Points:
-----------------
When you execute this command on a PC-FX board or PC-FXGA, the lead-out area
address returns the actual address + 1.


*** About interrupting a READ command

When you execute a SCSI READ command, you cannot normally interrupt the
command unless the host (PC-FX) has read all the data.

If you want to transfer data while reading video data from a CD-ROM (during
READ), you can interrupt the READ by sending an ABORT message to the CD-ROM
drive.

Sets the SCSI ATN to true while reading data. (ATTENSION state) When it
transitions to the MESSAGE OUT phase, it sends an ABORT message (06h) to the
target (CD-ROM drive).

The host (PC-FX) sets ATN to false when REQ is true and ACK is false in the
handshake with REQ and ACK at the end of the MESSAGE OUT phase.
The target then transitions to the BUS FREE phase to indicate that it has
responded to the message.

The host must continue to take in data (dummy read) until the target
transitions to the MESSAGE OUT phase and receives this message. (If you stop
the import, the state will never change.)

In other words, if you set ATN to true during data transfer, data import will
continue until the MESSAGE OUT phase is reached. The host (PC-FX) then sends
an ABORT message to the target (CD-ROM).
The target imports the MESSAGE and sets ATN to false. The target transitions
to the BUS FREE phase.

You can now interrupt the READ.

This is because the CD-ROM drive monitors the ATN on a block-by-block basis
during data transfer, and if the SCSI handshake is interrupted in the middle
of this, the CD-ROM drive will time out without noticing the ATN.
So, instead of letting it time out, you need to continue the dummy handshake
until the ATN is recognized.


*** About AUDIO PLAY

There are commands 4*h and D*h to execute AUDIO PLAY, but please use one of
the following three methods to use them.
    (1) Issue the 4*h command alone.
    (2) Issue D8h (PLAY bit = 1) alone.
    (3) Issue the D8h (PLAY bit = 0) and D9h commands as a pair.

    By using these,
     * the start address of the performance
     * the end address of the performance (lead-out area in the case of 2)
       are set,

     * Played in PLAY MODE (stereo, main, etc.).
       For 1 and 2, specify with page 0Eh of 15h, the default value is stereo.
       If you do not want to change it, there is no need to issue the 15h
       command.
       For 3, specify with D9h.

If you issue a 4Bh (PAUSE/RESUME), D2h (AUDIO SCAN), or DAh (STILL) command
after PLAY END has been reached (the specified playback end address has been
reached), an error (2Ch: NOT AUDIO PLAY STATE) will be returned.
In that case, issue a valid AUDIO PLAY-related command.

The CD-ROM drive does not retain the previous state and return to that state
after a command is executed (for example, issuing an AUDIO SCAN command during
PAUSE and then entering PAUSE operation after PLAY END), so such state
management should be done by each program separately.

Notes on address specification for PLAY commands

(1) When specifying a track number to play, you can set the end address to the
number of the track you want to play + 1, but if you want to play the 99th
track, you cannot specify this because 99 + 1 = 100. Do not create CDs with
99 tracks.
If you need to play a CD with 99 tracks, specify the end address
(lead out - 1) in the logical block address or ATIME, or issue the D8h
(PLAY bit = 1) command alone.

(2) You can specify an index to play with the 48h command, but if you specify
an index number that does not exist on the disc, the search will continue
indefinitely without returning an error.
As a general rule, do not use index numbers other than 1, and if you specify
another number, be sure to check that the CD has that track and index number
before specifying it.

The Sense Data Length (first byte) is the total number of data bytes excluding
itself; it is not affected by the number of transferred bytes in the CDB, and
is a value that changes depending on the DBD and page code.

If the DBD (Disable Block Descriptor) bit in the CDB is 0, the Block
Descriptor Length takes the value 08H, indicating that an 8-byte block
descriptor will be transferred after the header; if the DBD bit is 1, it
takes the value 00H, indicating that a page descriptor will be transferred
immediately after the header.

Specifies how to use the RAM on the CD-ROM.
The following values can be specified for the capacity of the read-ahead ring
buffer, the default being 0.

    0...256KB read-ahead ring buffer
    1...128KB read-ahead ring buffer
    2...No read-ahead ring buffer

By specifying this page and issuing "MODE SELECT", buffer management will be
initialized and the read-ahead ring buffer will be disabled.

Notes:
------
Make sure to specify 0 (256KB) as the capacity of the read-ahead ring buffer.

+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-+------+

Returns the number of errors processed within the CD-ROM. When setting this,
you would normally specify 0 to clear the count value.

This error is an ECC error when reading data, and one error will be counted as
one, regardless of the error retry value. After specifying this page with
"MODE SELECT" and clearing the count value, an error will be counted if an ECC
error occurs while executing READ (6, 10, 12 byte commands) and VERIFY
(10, 12 byte commands).

You can specify this page with "MODE SENSE" and read the error count value up
to that point.

+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-+------+

Specifies the pitch control value during PLAY.
The variable width is 1% per unit, and the variable range is -10% to 10%
(value = F6H to 0AH).

The operation can be specified during PLAY or other than PLAY (including STOP
state), and the previous pitch will be maintained even when the next PLAY
command is issued after STOP.

The default state (value = 00H) will be restored when the power is turned on
or the SCSI bus is reset.

Notes:
------
Even if this command is executed on a PC-FX board or PC-FXGA, the pitch will
not change and a "normal completion status" will be returned.

Any settings other than the above combinations, such as reverse output, will
result in an error.

The operation settings can be specified during or outside of PLAY, and after
STOP, the previous settings will be retained even for the next PLAY command.
The initial state (IMMED=1, STEREO) will be restored when the power is turned
on or the SCSI bus is reset.

Notes:
------
PC-FX boards and PC-FXGAs may always play in stereo. (Depends on the connected
drive). After the command has finished, a "normal completion status" will be
returned.

(6) Byte 09: Retry Count

This specifies the number of retries (re-reading the target block) allowed
when an error occurs.

A maximum of 15 times can be specified, and a retry count of 0 means that
retries are not allowed.

Once a mode is set, it remains valid until the "MODE SELECT" command is
issued again.

The following shows the initial settings (or the settings when the parameter
list length is 00H).

Initial settings
(1) XA/SH/EC/EJ
    When DISC ID is other than 20H (CD-ROM XA)
      XA=0, SH=0, EC=0, EJ=00
    When DISC ID is 20H (CD-ROM XA)
      XA=1, SH=1, EC=0, EJ=01
      (For DISC ID, see the READ TOC command.)

(2) Number of retries

============================================

Chapter 5 - Sense Data List
---------------------------

The contents of each status are explained below.

(1) GOOD status (00000000B)
This indicates that the command execution was completed successfully.

(2) CHECK CONDITION status (00000010B)
The "CHECK CONDITION" status is returned to the initiator if the following
errors or abnormalities occur:
  - If there is an error in the initiator's operation.
  - If the command specified by the initiator cannot be executed.
  - If the CD-ROM drive detects a hardware error.
  - If an error occurs during command execution, causing execution to
    terminate abnormally.

The CD-ROM drive that returns the "CHECK CONDITION" status generates sense
data describing the error.

The initiator can receive the sense data and check the error by issuing the
"REQUEST SENSE" command.

(3) BUSY status (00001000B)
The CD-ROM drive is in a BUSY state as shown below and cannot accept commands
from the initiator.
  -The CD-ROM drive is operating in response to a request from another
   initiator.
  -The CD-ROM drive is currently in a BUSY state due to a SEEK operation, etc.

(4) RESERVATION CONFLICT Status (00011000B)
This indicates that the CD-ROM drive has been reserved by another initiator
and cannot be used until the reservation is released.


5-1  Sense Data
---------------

The sense data indicates detailed error information related to the CD-ROM
drive, and the sense data content is valid when the "CHECK CONDITION" status
is returned.

The initiator can read the sense data by issuing the "REQUEST SENSE" command.

The sense data for CD-ROM drives is extended sense data (ERROR CLASS = 7), and
the length of all sense data is 18 bytes.

The format of the sense data (ERROR CLASS = 7, ERROR CODE = 0) is shown below.

     Table 1. Structure of sense data

The meaning of each parameter in the extended sense data is as follows.

(1) Byte 00, Bit7: VALID
When this bit is "1", the information shown in Bytes03 to 06 is valid.

(2) Byte 02: SENSE KEY
Indicates the cause of the error. For details, see "Table 2 SUB ERROR
CLASS/CODE".

(3) Bytes 03 - 06: INFORMATION BYTE
Only when the VALID bit is 1, it indicates the address information where the
error occurred. However, depending on the type of command that caused the
error, one of the following three types of address information will be
displayed.

1) Logical Block Address
